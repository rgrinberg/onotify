Overview
********
   Onotify is an OCaml binding for the Linux Inotify framework.

   This project is a fork of ocaml-inotify, another Inotify OCaml binding initiated by [1]Vincent
   Hanquez which can be found [2]here.

   Yet, Onotify is heavily based on this initial project and I would like to thank Vincent Hanquez for
   his work.

   The essential differences between Onotify and the initial project are :
     * a new build system based on OCamlbuild, GNU make and a shell script ;
     * some slight changes in the API, especially :
          + a call to Inotify.read can now be safely blocking ;
          + use of Unix.Unix_error to report runtime errors
     * a documented API using ocamldoc ;
     * a slightly improved test program ;
     * the drop of the Inotify compatibility header (yet still present under unused/)
