Overview
********
Onotify is an OCaml binding of the Linux Inotify framework.

This project is a fork of ocaml-inotify, another Inotify OCaml binding initiated by
Vincent Hanquez <vincent@snarc.org> which can be found here :
http://projects.snarc.org/ocaml-inotify

Yet, Onotify is heavily based on this initial project and I would like
to thank Vincent Hanquez for his work.

The essential differences between Onotify and the initial project are :
    - a new build system based on OCamlbuild, GNU make and a shell script ;
    - some slight changes in the API, especially :
	- a call to Inotify.read can now be safely blocking
	- use of Unix.Unix_error to report runtime errors
    - a documented API using ocamldoc
    - a slightly improved test program
    - the drop of the Inotify compatibility header (yet still present under unused/)
