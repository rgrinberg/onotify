Overview
********
Onotify is an OCaml binding for the Linux Inotify framework.

This project is a fork of ocaml-inotify, another Inotify OCaml binding initiated by
Vincent Hanquez <vincent@snarc.org> which can be found here :
http://projects.snarc.org/ocaml-inotify

Yet, Onotify is heavily based on this initial project and I would like
to thank Vincent Hanquez for his work.

The essential differences between Onotify and the initial project are :
    - a new build system based on OCamlbuild, GNU make and a shell script ;
    - some slight changes in the API, especially :
	- a call to Inotify.read can now be safely blocking
	- use of Unix.Unix_error to report runtime errors
    - a documented API using ocamldoc
    - a slightly improved test program
    - the drop of the Inotify compatibility header (yet still present under unused/)

Project hosting
***************
Onotify is essentially hosted on OCamlForge, the forge of OCamlCore.

There are two main URLs to obtain informations on Onotify :
    - the project homepage   : http://onotify.forge.ocamlcore.org
    - the project forge page : https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/onotify

Yet, the soure code is hosted on GitHub at : http://github.com/lstordeur/onotify

As GitHub lets to suppose, Onotify uses Git as Source Content Management system.

You can clone the Git repository using :
    HTTP : http://github.com/lstordeur/onotify.git
    Git	 : git://github.com/lstordeur/onotify.git


Keep informed about Onotify new releases
****************************************
You can subscribe to the low-traffic mailing-list : onotify-announce@lists.forge.ocamlcore.org
to be informed about Onotify new releases.


Reporting bugs
**************
The main and preferred way (for me :)) to report bugs is to use the Bug Tracking System on GitHub.

Yet, this method requires you to have an account on GitHub.
Thus, if you do not really want to subscribe to GitHub, you can use the other mailing-list :
onotify-devel@lists.forge.ocamlcore.org


Contributing and asking questions
*********************************
You can contribute or ask for some questions related to Onotify
using the medium-traffic mailing-list : onotify-devel@lists.forge.ocamlcore.org
