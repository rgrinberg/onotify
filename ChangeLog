Onotify 0.6.1 (Oct 5th 2010)
============================
This is mainly a bugfix release.

Build system :
    * fixed: ocamlfind package name switched from inotify to onotify. This is to
    prevent a name clash with the ocaml-inotify project.
    Thanks to Sylvain le Gall for this bug report.
    * changed: ocamlfind ld.conf is no longer updated when Onotify is not installed in
    the same tree as the ocamlfind one.
    * improved: minor typo updates

Test program :
    * improved: minor typo updates and code cleanups
