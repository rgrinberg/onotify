Onotify 0.6 (September 22th 2010)
=================================

This the first public release of Onotify.

Onotify 0.6.1 (October 5th 2010)
================================

This is mainly a bugfix release.

Fixed :
    * ocamlfind package name switched from inotify to onotify. This is to
    prevent a name clash with the ocaml-inotify project.
    Thanks to Sylvain le Gall for this bug report.

Changed :
    * ocamlfind ld.conf is no longer updated when Onotify is not installed in
    the same tree as the ocamlfind one.
    * Minor typo updates in the build system and code cleanup in the test
    program.
