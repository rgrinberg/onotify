Overview of the build system
****************************
The overall build system is composed of a configuration shell script and a GNU
Makefile layered on top of the OCamlbuild system.


The easiest way
***************
Building and installing Onotify is essentially a matter of executing the
following commands from the top of the project tree :

$ ./configure --prefix=<installation directory>

$ make install

This will build and install the library as well as the associated documentation.


Executing unit tests
********************
Onotify is shipped with a set of unit tests which can be executed to validate
some of the library functionalities.

To do this, you just have to execute the following command instead of 'make
install' :

$ make check


Tuning the configuration phase
******************************
The 'configure' script supports a variety of options and environment variables
to customize the configuration phase. The exhaustive option list can be seen
with the following command :

$ ./configure --help


Cleaning the project tree
*************************
You can easily remove all files produced during the build phase with the
following command :

$ make clean

or, if you wish to remove also the files produced during the configuration
phase :

$ make distclean


Building Out Of Source NOT SUPPORTED
************************************
Unlike many other build systems such as Autotools, you must execute the
configure script from the top of the project tree.


Makefile other targets
**********************
The makefile supports some other targets :

make lib    : build only the OCaml part of the library
make stubs  : build only the C part of the library
make doc    : build only the documentation
make test   : build only the unit tests (but do not execute them)
make dist   : produce a tarball of the project (works only from a Git
	      repository)
